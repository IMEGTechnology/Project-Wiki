# Project-WikiBase — Changelog

*One entry per shipped deploy zip. Newest at top. Not a substitute for the session log — this is the short version, for tracking what actually went out the door.*

*Note: v0.8c / v0.8d / v0.8e-1 below are reconstructed from partial notes — those sessions moved the app forward without a session-log entry at the time (a known documentation gap). Everything from v0.9a onward is tracked in full going forward.*

## v0.9c — 2026-07-20

**Changed:** `index.html`

- Fixed a major image bug: `renderInline()` restores images/links into text with `s.replace(placeholder, html)`. Plain-string `.replace()` treats `$&`, `` $` ``, `$'`, `$$` in the replacement as special patterns even without a regex, so an image name, alt text, or link title containing a lone `$` (a cost figure, a filename with a dollar sign) spliced fragments of the surrounding raw markdown into the rendered page — the stray `'">` and swallowed/uncollapsible headings Jayson was seeing. Fixed by passing a replacer function instead of the raw string on both the link/image and code restore lines, so the replacement is always inserted literally.
- H6 headings now get a color instead of falling back to gray — added purple to the Minimal theme's heading palette (`#9e86c8`, confirmed against Obsidian Minimal's own `--color-purple`), completing the existing red→orange→yellow→green→blue rainbow.
- Tables: top/bottom spacing around the table is now padding, not margin (margin was collapsing against the paragraph above, making the top gap read thinner than the bottom). Header row font size now matches the body (14px, was 12px). Tables are content-width and left-justified instead of forced to 100%, matching Obsidian — cells only wrap when the table would otherwise overflow the reader column.
- Outline panel now walks headings H1–H6 (was capped at H3). Removed a stray CSS override that shrank H3 outline entries to 11px while every other level was 12px.
- Outline's active item and the Vault browser's active file now share the same highlight treatment: accent-tinted background plus the existing colored text and right border, instead of text color alone.
- Reader panel back button is now a Back/Forward pair (top-left, mirrors Properties/Edit on the opposite corner). Removed the redundant Back button from the top header bar. Added a session-only forward stack alongside the existing back stack — Back moves the page you're leaving onto Forward's stack and vice versa, same as a browser tab; any other navigation clears Forward's stack.

## v0.9b-1 — 2026-07-20

**Changed:** `index.html`

- Fixed heading links showing a literal `#` in the rendered text. `[[#Header Name]]` (same-page) was displaying as "#Header Name" instead of "Header Name" — the display-text fallback was building itself from the raw `#heading` fragment instead of the heading name alone. Linking to a heading in another file (`[[File Name#Header Name]]`) still shows just the file name, unchanged — no `#` was found in that path on inspection; flagged for Jayson to confirm after this fix.

## v0.9b — 2026-07-20

**Changed:** `index.html`

- Folder/file-share links (`file://` UNC or drive paths) no longer attempt to open — browsers can't launch a native Explorer/Finder window from a page link, and the attempt was navigating to a broken URL. Clicking one now copies a cleaned, decoded path (no percent-encoding) to the clipboard and shows a brief "Copied to clipboard" confirmation, ready to paste into Explorer's address bar.
- Fixed a real bug this surfaced: bold/italic/strikethrough/highlight parsing ran on the raw line before links and images were parsed out, so `_`, `*`, `~~`, or `==` inside a link target or filename got read as formatting and silently eaten (this is why underscores were vanishing and paths looked "trimmed" when copied). Links and images are now protected in placeholder slots immediately, the same technique already used for inline code, before any formatting regex runs. Fixes every existing link/image/note title with one of those characters in its target, not just the new folder-link feature.
- Reader corner controls: removed the pill background/border around Collapse all/Collapse unused/Expand all — now plain icon buttons with one separator against Properties instead of a rounded group.
- Vault sidebar header: added a bold "Vault Files" label, removed the divider line below it. The three fold buttons now hide as a group (not individually) when the sidebar narrows enough that they'd crowd the label, and reappear once there's room.
- Outline panel header: same treatment — text label "Outline" (was an icon), divider line removed. Lock toggle (independent/shared fold state) stays, positioned left of the fold buttons with its own separator; the whole group (lock + fold buttons) hides together at narrow widths, same mechanism as the sidebar.
- Comments, Links, Review changes, and Search panel headers now match the same left-justified label style, divider line removed. No button group on these — nothing to hide.

## v0.9a-5 — 2026-07-19

**Changed:** `index.html`

- Outline panel now folds. A chevron appears on any heading that has a nested heading below it (leaf headings get no chevron); clicking it hides/shows just its own descendant entries.
- New lock toggle in the Outline toolbar, left of Collapse all / Collapse unused / Expand all: unlocked (default) keeps the Outline's fold state independent of the reader; locked shares the reader's own per-file fold memory, so folding a heading either place folds it both places.
- Outline's Collapse all / Collapse unused / Expand all are now wired up — Collapse unused keeps the active heading and its ancestor chain expanded, same rule as the sidebar and reader fold pill.

---

## v0.9a-4 — 2026-07-19

**Changed:** `index.html`

- Added Collapse all / Collapse unused / Expand all icons to the sidebar (vault browser). Collapse unused keeps the folder path to the currently open file expanded, closes everything else.
- Added a matching fold-control pill (neutral gray, not accent-colored) to the reader panel, left of Properties — same three actions, over the open file's own heading sections. Collapse unused keeps the current heading (per Outline's active-heading tracking) and its ancestor headings expanded.
- Added a Back button: one next to the sidebar toggle in the header, one mirrored top-left of the reader panel (opposite Properties/Edit, same size). Session-only "previous note" history, multiple steps back, resets on reload.
- New/Move header icons are now fully hidden when Settings → Enable editing is off, instead of grayed out. Shown at full weight (matching every other header icon) when it's on.
- Renamed Advanced Settings → "Enable editing (New / Move / Edit)" to "Enable editing".
- The version tag (bottom-right) is now clickable — opens a Changelog view in the reader, same behavior as Help (including the Outline-refresh fix from v0.9a-3, so Outline doesn't show stale headings).
- **Outline panel fold carrots + collapse state deliberately not built this session** — carved out to a dedicated session (spec logged in `kickoff-prompt.md`, section ③b).

## v0.9a-3 — 2026-07-16

**Changed:** `index.html`

- Fixed nested callouts — `>>` and `>>>` now render as proper nested callouts/blockquotes (previously only one level of `>` worked).
- Sidebar and right-panel resize handles now require a double-click to collapse, not a single click.
- Fixed a bug where opening Help left the Outline panel showing the previous file's headings; clicking one could error out.
- Rebuilt the Links panel: now shows the current file's own links, categorized as MD Files / Websites / Folders / Other, above the existing (session-scoped) Backlinks list.
- Added per-heading collapse memory — folded sections now persist per file, like Obsidian.
- Tuned spacing above/below headings, especially around the H2 underline.
- **Not fixed, tracked open:** a Markdown file reportedly froze the app once. Held pending reproduction — need the actual file to diagnose properly instead of guessing at a fix.

---

## v0.9a-2 — 2026-07-16

**Changed:** `index.html`

- Added a manual PWA update-available indicator (up-arrow icon, appears when a new version has taken over the service worker; click reloads).
- Reworked the Review tab: vault-wide overview (File changes / New files) always shown at the top, per-file card list unchanged below it.

---

## v0.9a-1 — 2026-07-16

**Changed:** `index.html`

- Moved the file audit out of Settings entirely; folded into the Review changes screen as a "New Files" section.
- Fixed review-card click sometimes highlighting the wrong line in the reader (was matching short blocks, often the title, instead of the actual change).
- Fixed Minimal theme header colors — pulled the real hex values from Obsidian Minimal's own theme.css instead of placeholder colors.

---

## v0.9a — 2026-07-16

**Changed:** `index.html`

- Fixed a boot bug where nested open subfolders got stuck on "Loading…" (only top-level open folders were being preloaded).
- Added Settings → Navigation → "Open last note" (default on) — boot reopens the last file you had open instead of restoring exact folder state.
- Compressed Header colors + Background color into one settings row.
- Added a read-only file audit (flags files WikiBase has never written to, i.e. never touched/reviewed).
- Fixed Minimal theme H1/H2 color swap.

---

## v0.8e-1 — 2026-07-16 *(reconstructed, partial)*

**Changed:** `index.html`

- Minimal theme identity work, H2 underline toggle, image-size syntax (`![[img.png|width]]`), Theme settings sub-grouping.
- Full change detail not captured at the time — flagged as a documentation gap, not reconstructed further.

---

## v0.8d — 2026-07-16 *(reconstructed, partial)*

**Changed:** `index.html`

- Incremental theme/settings work between v0.8c and v0.8e-1. Detail not captured at the time.

---

## v0.8c — 2026-07-16 *(reconstructed, partial)*

**Changed:** `index.html`
